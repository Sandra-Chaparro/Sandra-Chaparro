Hello there 👋, I'm Sandra Chaparro



   💻 This account shows a couple of projects that I have done as a freelance, in a cohort and when I was at school learning new technologies.

  - 👩🏻‍🎓 I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Information Systems Engineering in 2022.
  - 👩🏼‍💻I finished my Co-Op as a software engineer (alongside completing my final semester of university) and I am ready to    
    start a full time opportunity to keep growing and contributing using my skills and knowledge. 🧠 💡
  - 👩🏻‍🏫 I am currently working as a Software Consultant creating web technologies for small businesses in North Texas using: 
    Javascript, ReactJS, MongoDB, Vite, Python, Tailwind, etc.
  - I finished a cohort project last year (2024) with the Dallas Software Developers where we created a Grocery Managment 
    Tool using MERN stack, and I am currently in my second cohort, as of February 2025.


  - Currently I am also learning about Generative AI and Quantum Computing.
